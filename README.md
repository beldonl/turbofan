# Turbofan

This repository contains a signomial programming compatible version of Proessor Mark Drela's TASOPT turbofan engine model. The methodology used to create this model is documented in the AIAA Journal of Aircraft paper "Turbofan Engine Sizing and Tradeoff Analysis via Signomial Programming." The paper can be found at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.C034463 and http://convex.mit.edu/publications/turbofanSP.pdf.
